A simple Node Chat project using Node.js and Angular.js to display the front end dynamically. 

This was created based off previous examples, and was mainly to allow me to understand WebSockets better. 

**Barred Words**
Certain words can be configured to be "barred" from being said.
If you say a sentence with containing any of these words, the sentence will not be broadcasted.
The attempt will also be logged in the log file.

In the future you could make API calls whenever those words are mentioned, close the server or even just log in a text file.
